# Web Reconnaissance

Web reconnaissance is the first step in any security assessment or penetration testing engagement. It's akin to a detective's initial investigation, meticulously gathering clues and evidence about a target before formulating a plan of action. In the digital realm, this translates to accumulating information about a website or web application to identify potential vulnerabilities, security misconfigurations, and valuable assets.

## Primary Goals of Web Reconnaissance

The primary goals of web reconnaissance revolve around gaining a comprehensive understanding of the target's digital footprint. This includes:

- **Identifying Assets**: Discovering all associated domains, subdomains, and IP addresses provides a map of the target's online presence.
- **Uncovering Hidden Information**: Web reconnaissance aims to uncover directories, files, and technologies that are not readily apparent and could serve as entry points for an attacker.
- **Analyzing the Attack Surface**: By identifying open ports, running services, and software versions, you can assess the potential vulnerabilities and weaknesses of the target.
- **Gathering Intelligence**: Collecting information about employees, email addresses, and technologies used can aid in social engineering attacks or identifying specific vulnerabilities associated with certain software.

## Types of Web Reconnaissance

Web reconnaissance can be conducted using either active or passive techniques, each with its own advantages and drawbacks:

| Type | Description | Risk of Detection | Examples |
|------|------------|------------------|----------|
| **Active Reconnaissance** | Involves directly interacting with the target system, such as sending probes or requests. | Higher | Port scanning, vulnerability scanning, network mapping |
| **Passive Reconnaissance** | Gathers information without directly interacting with the target, relying on publicly available data. | Lower | Search engine queries, WHOIS lookups, DNS enumeration, web archive analysis, social media |

## WHOIS

WHOIS is a query and response protocol used to retrieve information about domain names, IP addresses, and other internet resources. It provides details such as domain ownership, registration date, and contact information.

### Example Command:
```bash
whois example.com
```
This command returns information including the registrar, registration and expiration dates, nameservers, and contact details.

## DNS (Domain Name System)

The Domain Name System (DNS) translates user-friendly domain names into numerical IP addresses. DNS enumeration helps in understanding a target's infrastructure.

### Example Command:
```bash
dig example.com A
```
This command retrieves the A record (IPv4 address) of the domain.

### Common DNS Record Types:

| Record Type | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| **A** | Maps a hostname to an IPv4 address. |
| **AAAA** | Maps a hostname to an IPv6 address. |
| **CNAME** | Creates an alias for a hostname. |
| **MX** | Specifies mail servers responsible for email handling. |
| **NS** | Delegates a DNS zone to an authoritative name server. |
| **TXT** | Stores arbitrary text information. |
| **SOA** | Contains administrative information about a DNS zone. |

## Subdomains

Subdomains are extensions of a primary domain, often used for organizing services. Discovering subdomains can expose additional attack surfaces.

### Subdomain Enumeration Techniques:

| Approach | Description | Examples |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| **Active Enumeration** | Directly interacts with the target's DNS servers. | Brute-forcing, DNS zone transfers |
| **Passive Enumeration** | Relies on public sources without direct interaction. | Certificate Transparency (CT) logs, search engine queries |

### Subdomain Brute-Forcing

Brute-forcing subdomains involves systematically testing potential subdomain names.

#### Example Command:
```bash
dnsenum example.com -f subdomains.txt
```

## Zone Transfers

A DNS zone transfer (AXFR) provides a complete copy of a DNS zone file, listing all subdomains and associated records.

#### Example Command:
```bash
dig @ns1.example.com example.com axfr
```
Note: Many DNS servers restrict zone transfers to authorized hosts only.

## Virtual Hosts

Virtual hosting allows multiple websites to share a single IP address. Brute-forcing virtual hosts helps identify hidden services.

#### Example Command:
```bash
gobuster vhost -u http://192.0.2.1 -w hostnames.txt
```

## Certificate Transparency (CT) Logs

CT logs record SSL/TLS certificates issued for domains, revealing subdomains.

#### Example Command:
```bash
curl -s "https://crt.sh/?q=%25.example.com&output=json" | jq -r '.[].name_value' | sed 's/\*\.//g' | sort -u
```

## Web Crawling

Web crawling systematically explores a website's structure, uncovering hidden resources.

### Example Scrapy Spider:
```python
import scrapy

class ExampleSpider(scrapy.Spider):
    name = "example"
    start_urls = ['http://example.com/']

    def parse(self, response):
        for link in response.css('a::attr(href)').getall():
            if not link.startswith("#") and not link.startswith("mailto:"):
                yield response.follow(link, callback=self.parse)
```

### Extracting Links from Crawled Data:
```bash
jq -r '.[] | select(.file != null) | .file' example_data.json | sort -u
```

## Search Engine Discovery (Google Dorking)

Google Dorking uses search operators to uncover hidden information.

| Operator | Description | Example |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| **site:** | Restricts search results to a specific website. | `site:example.com` |
| **filetype:** | Searches for specific file types. | `filetype:pdf site:example.com` |
| **intitle:** | Searches for pages with a specific title. | `intitle:"index of"` |
| **inurl:** | Finds URLs containing specific keywords. | `inurl:admin` |

By leveraging these techniques, web reconnaissance provides valuable insights into a target's infrastructure, potential vulnerabilities, and security posture.
